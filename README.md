# TOP_RestaurantPage

As part of The Odin Project's JavaScript curriculum, I developed a dynamic restaurant homepage using JavaScript for DOM manipulation and Webpack for module bundling.

Key Features:

Single Page Application (SPA): Implemented tabbed navigation for seamless content switching without page reloads.

Modular JavaScript: Utilized ES6 modules to organize code, enhancing maintainability and readability.

Webpack Integration: Configured Webpack for efficient bundling and asset management, streamlining the development process.

Responsive Design: Ensured the page is accessible and visually appealing across various devices and screen sizes.

Technologies Used:

JavaScript (ES6)

Webpack

HTML5

CSS3
